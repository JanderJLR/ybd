# ybd is designed to be run from the command line and/or as part of an
# automated pipeline. all configuration is taken from conf files and/or
# environment variables, in the following order of precedence:
#
#    YBD_* environment variables            # if found
#    ./kbas.conf                            # if found
#    $path/to/kbas.py/kbas.conf             # if found
#    $path/to/kbas.py/kbas/config/kbas.conf # default, as provided in ybd repo
#
# this means you can set custom config via env vars, or the definitions
# top-level directory, or the ybd top-level directory, without having to modify
# the supplied default ybd.conf file.

# NOTE: it is recommended to create your own kbas.conf file, so you can merge
# new/latest ybd using git with no possibility of a conflict, and your custom
# settings will continue to take precedence.
#
# to set config via environment variables, each must be prefixed with ```YBD_```
# and using ```_``` instead of ```-```. ybd will strip the YBD_ prefix and
# convert ```_``` to ```-```, for example

# more logging with 'development' than 'production'
mode: development

# directory to serve from
artifact-dir: '/src/artifacts'

# To enable HTTPS, you need a certificate and private-key
# FIXME: and maybe a certificate-chain: ???
# note if these values don't point to a valid file, kbas defaults to http
certificate: ./server.pem
private-key: ./server.pem

# to populate the above, generate a cert and key in the working dir, eg:
# `openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -days 365 -nodes`

# ip address or hostmame of machine to serve on. 0.0.0.0 should work for most
# cases... '0.0.0.0 means all IPv4 addresses on the local machine'
host: 0.0.0.0

# port to serve on
port: 8000

# password for uploads. Note: the code expressly rejects 'insecure' as a
# password - you need to change this default, unless you don't need upload
# (eg, where you're running kbas on a ybd build machine directly)
password: 'insecure'
